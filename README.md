# PyBer_Analysis


#### Overview of Analysis

###### The purpose of this analysis was to compare fares customers paid for ride-sharing based on the type of city they were living in. We also looked to see how much money each driver was making


#### Results

##### We can conclude rides are most expensive in Rural cities, and cheaper in comparison, in Urban cities. As the count over drivers in the city type decreases, the average Fare per Ride increases. Urban cities generated total fares of $39,854.38 compared to the $19,356.33 & $4,327.93 made by Suburban and Rural cities, respectively.
