# PyBer_Analysis


#### Overview of Analysis

###### The purpose of this analysis was to compare fares customers paid for ride-sharing based on the type of city they were living in. We also looked to see how much money each driver was making


#### Results

##### We can conclude rides are most expensive in Rural cities, and cheaper in comparison, in Urban cities. As the count over drivers in the city type decreases, the average Fare per Ride increases. Urban cities generated total fares of $39,854.38 compared to the $19,356.33 & $4,327.93 made by Suburban and Rural cities, respectively. It is also very important to note that Urban cities, by far, have more drivers available. Below you can see the breakdown:

#### Summary

###### As you can see below, the disparity among Fares per Ride based on the City Type is consistent throughout the year. Below, we have a graph showing the timeframe of January to April. To maybe close the gap between costs by City Type, you can maybe insert incentives to increase the number of fairs in suburban and rural cities as well as incentize drivers to visit those areas more frequently to lower the average cost.
